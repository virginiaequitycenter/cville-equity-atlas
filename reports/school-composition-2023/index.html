<p>The tables below provide the demographic composition of
Charlottesville and Albemarle Schools for 2022-2023, 2021-2022,
2020-2021, and 2019-2020.</p>
<p>These numbers reflect Fall Membership numbers provided by the
Virginia Department of Education’s <a href="https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex_captcha/home.do?apexTypeId=304">Fall
Membership Build-a-Table site</a>.</p>
<p>According to VDOE documentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Race or Ethnicity captures “the racial category that most closely
reflects the student’s recognition of his or her community or with which
the student identifies”</li>
<li>Economic status “identifies students as economically disadvantaged
if they meet any one of the following: 1) is eligible for Free/Reduced
Meals, or 2) receives TANF, or 3) is eligible for Medicaid, or 4)
identified as either Migrant or experiencing Homelessness.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Scroll further right to see the percent of a school’s student body by
race and the number and percent of students identified as economically
disadvantaged. The tables can be sorted by any column by clicking on the
