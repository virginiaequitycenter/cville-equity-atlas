    <p><strong>Equitable Analysis centers community-driven partnership to provide advocates as well as civic-and private-sector leaders with data and metrics, contextualized analysis, interactive maps and data visualizations, and narrative storytelling as a resource in pursuit of equity throughout the region.</strong></p>

    <p>Following the UVA Equity Centerâ€™s commitment to authentic partnership and shared power, we work <em>with</em> community members, rather than <em>for</em>. Through deep engagement with impacted communities, we gather insights and information to accurately measure and articulate regional patterns of racial and socioeconomic inequity, with an eye toward institutional accountability.</p>

    <p>Guided by principles of justice, openness, accessibility, and reproducibility, these projects highlight critical assets in our region and underscore opportunities for collective action toward institutional and systemic change.</p>
