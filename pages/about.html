    <h2>Community-Centered Analysis</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>
</div>

<div>

    <p><strong>Community-Centered Analysis centers on community-driven partnerships to provide advocates, as well as civic and private sector leaders, with data and metrics, contextualized analysis, interactive maps and data visualizations, and narrative storytelling as a resource in pursuit of a more just region.</strong></p>

    <p>Following the UVA Center for Community Partnershipsâ€™s commitment to authentic partnership and shared power, we work <em>with</em> community members, rather than <em>for</em>. Through deep engagement with impacted communities, we gather insights and information to accurately measure and articulate various forms of disparity in the region with an eye toward institutional accountability.</p>

    <p>Guided by principles of justice, openness, accessibility, and reproducibility, these projects highlight critical assets in our region and underscore opportunities for collective action toward institutional and systemic change.</p>
