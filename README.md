# Charlottesville Regional Equity Atlas

This is the repository for the [Charlottesville Regional Equity Atlas](https://virginiaequitycenter.github.io/cville-equity-atlas/) site, and documentation related to updating the site.

There's a [homepage for all Atlas-related documentation here](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/cville-equity-atlas/tree/main/docs/README.md). This includes information on Jekyll, working with the site locally, publishing updates, and incorporating R Markdown documents.

Refresh your knowledge on the basics of cloning a Github repo, pushing and pulling updates to/from the remote repository and command line for Mac and Windows users. See documentation: [Working with the Github Repo and Command Line](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/cville-equity-atlas/blob/main/docs/command-line.md)
